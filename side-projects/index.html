	Synology DSM AudioStation is a great application to listen to your music online but I miss some more extra-functionalities such as last.fm integration, shortcut access, etc. AudioStation Steroids will try to provide an easy way of extending and improving the original AudioStation. This web page is where news, updates and so will be found. Right now it have just published and I hope to inform some news soon. If you detect a problem or just want a new functionality to be implemented please report it in GitHub Issues. The source code of the project is published in this GitHub. The Chrome Extension here and the server side of the project here.
