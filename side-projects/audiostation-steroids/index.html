	<a href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/home_home_applications_audio_station.php?lang=enu" target="_blank">Synology DSM AudioStation </a> is a great application to listen to your music online but I miss some more extra-functionalities.
	<br>
	AudioStation Steroids is a Chrome Extension that will try to provide an easy way of extending and improving the original AudioStation with last.fm integration,keyboard shortcut access, etc.
	<br>
	Right now it was just published and I hope to inform some news soon, you can find and install it in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/audiostation-steroids/bmbaoffaphmekjaffppohjacnbpdnfej" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>.
	<br>
	If you detect a problem or just would like a new functionality to be implemented please report it in <a href="https://github.com/robertovg/audiostation-steroids/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a>.
	<br>
	This is a free software and the the sources of the project are 
	published in this GitHub: The Chrome Extension <a href="https://github.com/robertovg/audiostation-steroids" target="_blank">in this repository</a> and the server side of the project <a href="https://github.com/robertovg/steroids-gateway" target="_blank">here</a>.
	The Icon was designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/nuriaasB612" target="_blank">@nuriaasB612</a>.

	<strong>Features:<strong>
