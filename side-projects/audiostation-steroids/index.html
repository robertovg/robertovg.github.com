	<a href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/home_home_applications_audio_station.php?lang=enu" target="_blank">Synology DSM AudioStation </a> is a great application to listen to your music online but I miss some more extra-functionalities.
	<br>
	AudioStation Steroids is a Chrome Extension that will try to provide an easy way of extending and improving the original AudioStation with last.fm integration,keyboard shortcut access, etc.
	<br>
	Right now it was just published and I hope to inform some news soon, you can find and install it in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/audiostation-steroids/bmbaoffaphmekjaffppohjacnbpdnfej" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>.
	<br>
	<strong>Service is now discontinued.</strong>
	The Github repositories contain the source code the services, but the server side of it has been disconnected.
	I recommend using any other of the many options available to scrobble your plays to last.fm. The source of the project ( both backend and frontend ) are available, so feel free to use it.
	<br>
	This is a free software and the the sources of the project are 
	published in this GitHub: The Chrome Extension <a href="https://github.com/robertovg/audiostation-steroids" target="_blank">in this repository</a> and the server side of the project <a href="https://github.com/robertovg/steroids-gateway" target="_blank">here</a>.
	The Icon was designed by <a href="http://nuriaperezdesign.com/" target="_blank">Nuria Pérez</a>.
	<br>
	<strong>Features:<strong>
	<ul>	
	<li>Scrobbling ( When you have listened more than 50% of a song)</li>
	<li>Now playing support ( When you start playing a song )</li>
	<li>Chrome icon indicates when scrobbling is working.</li>
	<li>Simple Configuration ( It's not necessary to provide the DMS URL, just connect to your Last.fm profile )</li>
	<li>Configuration synchronization through your Google Chrome Account, configure once.</li>
	<ul>
