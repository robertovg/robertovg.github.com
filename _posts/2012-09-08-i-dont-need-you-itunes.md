<p>Six month ago, I lost my dear iPod Classic witch I used every day for four years until this tragic moment... now I can say, I don't miss it at all.</p>
<img title="no iTunes" src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/posts/no-itunes.jpg" alt="no iTunes"   />
<p>When I lost it, I had a huge music library with about 70Gb and it has grown to more than 100Gb.</p>
<p>It's so comfortable to be able to listen your full library always when you want and off-line (without internet), only using this device, the bad part comes when you manage its content.</p>
<p>Yes, I now there are a severals alternatives to iTunes, but usually the owner of an iPod manage his library with iTunes, witch is the slower doing everything and use to fail. When I used to add an mp3 a had to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open iTunes, in my home pc.</li>
	<li>Add this mp3 to my library.</li>
	<li>Synchronize the iPod with iTuens.</li>
	<li>Enjoy this song only in this device.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a <a href="http://www.synology.com/us/products/DS211j/index.php" target="_blank">Synology DS211j</a>, one of best purchases I've ever made, after the loss I started using it as music streamer as well as NAS. Synology has his own Operative System accessible via HTTP called <a href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/index.php?lang=us" target="_blank">DSM</a>, so I can access to it anywhere and with any device. For example I listen to music at work via <a href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/home_home_applications_audio_station.php?lang=us" target="_blank">Synology Audio Station</a> through the browser, and with my iPhone and Android device with its <a href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/home_mobile_support_ds_audio.php?lang=us">DS audio</a>, so in this way I can access to my personal music library anywhere if I am connected to Internet. Well DS audio has the availability to make</p>
