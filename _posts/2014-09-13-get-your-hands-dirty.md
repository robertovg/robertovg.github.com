Well, I've spent 4 month as freelance and the most qualty 
-now I have the option to decide, better not too confortable to keep your mind in shape.
-know what's happening in the background
-try to do things differently as the fast way just to experiment and resolve the problems by your own, ... never copy code!!
-use terminal not too many plugins
-trust just in the essentiat ( vim, terminal.) no more, stay ready to change your work computer usually, to pickle your self.
-keep learning all the time, is imposible to survive in IT world if you stop your learning, because this is what this is about.
-Last and more important, consider yourself as craftsman not engenieer.

This is about keep improving all the time, otherwise you are out without realized.
